Overview
This site celebrates early 2000s music, designed with a throwback feel. It captures the bold and colorful vibe of that era.

Design Details
Colors
Hot Pink: Brings energy and nods to the 2000s love for bright colors.
Black: Offers contrast, making the site easy to read.
Light Pink: Adds soft accents and highlights.
Fonts
Main headings use "Shadows Into Light," a fun font that adds a playful touch.
Body text is in a simple sans-serif for clear reading.
Layout
The site uses Flexbox and Grid for a flexible layout that works on any screen size.
Media queries help the site look good on both phones and computers.
Interactive Parts
Links and buttons have hover effects, making the site more fun to explore.
I added short music clips to give a taste of the 2000s hits.
Challenges
Keeping the video header looking good without taking up too much space was tricky. I used CSS to control its size.
I worked to keep the text readable against the bright background colors.
